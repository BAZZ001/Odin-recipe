    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Sinigang</b> is a Filipino soup or stew characterized by its sour and savory taste. It is most often
        associated with
        tamarind, although it can use other sour fruits and leaves as the souring agent. It is one of the more popular
        dishes in Filipino cuisine.
