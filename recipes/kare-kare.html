        meat, and occasionally offal.

        <li>½ pound long beans, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>½ pound eggplant, cubed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>

                Combine the oxtails and water in a large pot; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer at
                least 2 hours.

                Skim as much fat from the top of the liquid as possible. Crumble the beef bouillon cubes into the liquid
                and allow to dissolve. Remove the meat from the broth and set aside. Add the bok choy, long beans, and
                eggplant to the broth and simmer until tender.

                While the vegetables simmer in the broth, heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and
                stir the onion and garlic in the hot oil until tender. Stir the achiote powder into the mixture to add a
                little color. Add the peanut butter and stir until it's melted into the mixture. Add about half the
                broth to the pot; bring to a simmer for 5 minutes. Add the oxtails and cook another 5 minutes before
                adding the remaining broth with the vegetables. Serve hot.
